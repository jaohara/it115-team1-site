# John's Page

This is an example of an update on "John's Page", which will be reflected in the browser.

As you can see, the development server running via [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) will detect the file change, compile the new static resources, and update the document in the browser. 

Similarly, any code that is merged in or pushed to the `main` branch on the [Github repo](https://github.com/jaohara/it115-team1-site) will be compiled and served on Github Pages.
